            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is about learning skills and knowledge. It also means helping
                people to learn how to do things and support them to think about what they learn. It is also important
                for educators to teach ways to find and use information. Education needs research to find out how to
                make it better.Through education, the knowledge of society, country, and of the world is passed on from
                generation to generation. This may include education in morality, for example learning how to act as
                loyal, honest and effective citizen.
                Learning in a library
                Education may help and guide individuals from one class to another. Educated people and groups can do
                things like help less-educated people and encourage them to get educated.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Formal education is usually in school, where a person may learn basic,
                academic, or trade skills. Small children often attend a nursery or kindergarten but often formal
                education begins in elementary school and continues with secondary school. Post-secondary education (or
                higher education) is usually at a college or university which may grant an academic degree. Or, students
                may go to a City college where they learn practical skills. This way learners can become qualified to be
                plumbers, electricians, builders and similar occupations. These course have arrangements for students to
                get practical experience. Apprenticeship was the older way to do this,Non-formal education includes
                adult basic education, adult literacy education or school equivalency preparation. In non-formal
                education, someone who is not in school can learn to read, write, and other basic life or job skills.
                Home education, individualized instruction (such as programmed learning), distance learning and
                computer-assisted instruction are other possibilities.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Informal education is less organized.[4] It may be a parent (like a dad
                or mom) teaching a child how to make a meal or ride a bicycle. People can also get an informal education
                by reading many books from a library or educational websites. This may also be called self-education.
                Some famous people have been largely self-educated, like Alfred Russell Wallace.

                Unschooling is when kids learn as they go and do not go to traditional school buildings. Instead, they
                go on websites, play games, or engage in normal hobbies and learn along the way. The experience of
                children with "unstructured" lives is that they get into trouble.[5]

                Deschooling is a more drastic approach. It advocates abolishing schools. It was put forward in the USA
                of the 1960s and 1970s. It is no longer an active movement.
